The next list will make your life easier when you want to load some content, display an image, or link some url with opencms.</p>\n<!--more Interested abouts paths?

The path to our jsp will be \"/extra/news/index.jsp\".\n<pre class=\"brush:java\">With the taglib we would do:\n&lt;cms:info property=\"opencms.request.folder\" /&gt;\n&lt;%-- prints out /extra/news/ --%&gt;</pre>\nUsing a scriptlet\n<pre class=\"brush:java\">String folderPath = cms.info(\"opencms.request.folder\");\n// Store \"/extra/news/\" in the variable folderPath</pre>\nUsing this, you will get your script to access to the content of the current folder. If you are using it to display news, you will only need to create a link to the file from other path to display their news.\n<h3>Adding the context path \"/opencms/opencms/\" to your links</h3>\nIn my computer I have several OpenCms installations, one of them in /opencms/opencms/ and other in /opencms752/opencms/, and I need my jsp to work in all of them. If I write a link in my jsp like this:\n<pre class=\"brush:html\">&lt;a href=\"/opencms/opencms/miimage.jpg\"&gt;My image&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\nIt wouldn't work in the /opencms752/opencms instalation. Instead hardcoding the link, in this case it is very useful the &lt;cms:link&gt; tag:\n<pre class=\"brush:java\">&lt;a href=\"&lt;cms:link&gt;/miimage.jpg&lt;/cms:link&gt;\"&gt;My image&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;%--\nWill link to\n/opencms/opencms/miimage.jpg in my /opencms/opencms installation and\n/opencms752/opencms/miimage.jpg in my /opencms752/opencms one.\n--%&gt;</pre>\nThis is the proper way of linking for HTML, use it with a, img, script, style and form HTML tags.\n<h3>Making a link work in the root site \"/\" and other sites \"/sites/default/\"</h3>\nImagine you need a bulletproof jsp that have to work if you call it from the administration area, whenever you are in the root site or in your /sites/default or any other site you have in your opencms.\nThis is typical when you are creating a administration section in opencms, you want to make it work the same way when you are in any site. Keep imagining that that jsp is the one from the first example that display the news list in the folder <em>/extra/news/</em>.\nIf you have your opencms in<em> \"/sites/default/\"</em> it will work for sure, but if you have it in the root site \"/\" it will return an error because you should search the news in the path <em>\"/sites/default/extra/news/\"</em>.\nYou can know when to add the <em>\"/sites/default/\" </em>prefix using the session manager:\n<pre class=\"brush:java\">&lt;%@ page import=\"org.opencms.main.OpenCms\" %&gt;\n&lt;%\nString currentSitePrefix = OpenCms.getSessionManager().getSessionInfo(session).getSiteRoot();\n/*\nThis will store \"/sites/default/\" or whatever site we are in the currentSitePrefix variable\nbut if we are in the root site this will store an empty String \"\".\n*/\n%&gt;</pre>\nSo when I need this functionality in my jsp's I use the following function:\n<pre class=\"brush:java\">&lt;%!\n/**\n* Add the site prefix to a path if we are in the root site \"/\"\n* @param path String - The path we want to check.\n* @param ses - The current HttpSession object.\n* @return The correct path depending on the current site.\n*/\nString getSitePath(String path, HttpSession ses){\n//If a file in the system folder is required we don't need to fix it,\n//because that folder is accessible from any site\nif(path.startsWith(\"/system/\"))\nreturn path;\n//If we are on the root site, we need to prepend the site prefix\nif(OpenCms.getSessionManager().getSessionInfo(ses).getSiteRoot().equals(\"\"))\nreturn org.opencms.main.OpenCms.getSiteManager().getDefaultSite().getSiteRoot() + path;\n//If we are on other site we don't need to add a prefix\nelse\nreturn path;\n}\n%&gt;\n&lt;%\nString path = getSitePath(\"/extra/news/\", session);\n//the path variable will contain \"/extra/news/\" if we are in the default site or \"/sites/default/extra/news/\" if we are in the root one.\n%&gt;</pre>\nThis function only works with the default site, if we have more sites in our opencms we can add another parameter to the function\nwith the prefix of the site to prepend. When you are using one OpenCms for multiple sites you will find the CmsSiteManager class documentation very useful.","frontmatter":{"date":"March 28, 2011","slug":"/articles/opencms-useful-paths-and-urls","title":"Opencms useful paths and urls","type":"article"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a35745ce-e1ef-512c-8dbe-ab6eafc22f0f","frontmatter__slug":"/articles/opencms-useful-paths-and-urls","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"articles"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
