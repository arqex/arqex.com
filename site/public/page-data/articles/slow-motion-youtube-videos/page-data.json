Now that most of the video sites use html5 video tags to render their videos, playing them in slowmotion is a piece of cake.</p>\n<p>I have created a bookmarklet to everyone who needs the same:</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p><a href=\"javascript:(function(){var v = document.querySelector('video');v.playbackRate = v.playbackRate == .5 ? 1 : .5;})()\">Slow motion video</a></p>\n<p>Just drag the link above and drop it on your bookmark bar, visit youtube or vimeo start a video and click on it. That's it, you should be watching your video at half of the original speed.</p>\n<h3>Looks great. How does it work?</h3>\r\nNowadays browser let the developer take the controls of how to display videos thanks to the &lt;video&gt; tag. That tag offers you an API to play, pause and seek video moments. And also there are a property called <strong>playbackRate</strong> to control the playback speed.\n<p>So the bookmarklet just fetch the video tag from the DOM and change the playbackRate value to 0.5</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:js decode:true\" title=\"Slow motion video scriptlet\" >(function(){\r\n\tvar v = document.querySelector('video');\r\n\tv.playbackRate = v.playbackRate == .5 ? 1 : .5;\r\n})();</pre> \n<p>As you can see, hitting the bookmark again will restore the playbackRate value to 1. Set values lower that 1 to play the video slower and bigger than 1 to play it faster. It is possible even to set negative values to play the video backwards.</p>\n<p>For playbackRate values lower than 0.5 the sound is muted.</p>\n<p>It is needed that the video is served in HTML5 format (default for most of browsers), otherwise it won't work.</p>\n<p>If you want to know more from the HTML5 video API, have a look at <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video\" title=\"HTML5 video API\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla's docs</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 02, 2014","slug":"/articles/slow-motion-youtube-videos","title":"Slow motion youtube videos","type":"article"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c5e00644-f979-5544-8060-4f1baf1f6156","frontmatter__slug":"/articles/slow-motion-youtube-videos","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"articles"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
