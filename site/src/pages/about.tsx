                    I was born in Sevilla, Spain, about 40 years ago. I started travelling soon and I ended up living in different places around the world: London, Dublin, Milano, Guatemala City...

                    Lately I've settled down in Barcelona, where I live since 2013. I love the cosmopolitan way of living here. The sea, the mountains, the weather, the food, the friends and a great cultural offer that makes this city a place where I feel at home.

                    I'm a very curious person and I love to learn new things all the time. I can say that technology and software development are my passion, but I extend my curiosity to other activities that are not very related, like woodworking or practicing sports.
                  </p>

                    Music is also a very important part of my life. I like all music genres, but I'm specially fond of flamenco that I love to listen all the time. I play the guitar too, including playing for some band some time ago.

                  <p>
                    I'm an extrovert person and I love to meet new people (weird for an IT guy uh?). Maybe, some day we might find ourselves together far, far away.
