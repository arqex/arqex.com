One of the most interesting feature of blockchain projects is that we don't need to trust anyone anymore. There are no intermediaries between us and the blockchain. When we need to transfer blockchain money or use any DeFi service, it's us interacting directly with the blockchain, and no other human or authority have a say in that interaction. That trustless feature allows us to create things that weren't possible before.
