If you find that Atom's default colors are ok, but you feel like the tabs are too big and the folder trees are wasting too much space, maybe you and I have some kind of thinking connection... :)

Fortunatelly, <strong>customizing atom is as easy as create a <em>less</em> file</strong>. I have created some styles to make atom feels a bit more like sublime text, making everything more compact:

<a href="http://arqex.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/atom-compact.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972" src="http://arqex.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/atom-compact.png" alt="atom-compact" width="835"  /></a>If you want to use these styles go to your atom's stylesheet:
<ul>
	<li>Click on Edit &gt; Open your stylesheet ( If you are using Mac / Linux )</li>
	<li>Click on File &gt; Open your stylesheet ( If you are using Windows )</li>
</ul>
Your stylesheet file for customizing atom will be in front of your eyes, so copy the <a title="Atom stylesheet gist" href="https://gist.github.com/arqex/2ccb3a70e4cc310c9439" target="_blank">following gist</a> there and save it:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/arqex/2ccb3a70e4cc310c9439.js"></script>

Comments and improvements to the stylesheet are welcome.
