<strong>Update - Check out the all new <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/custom-sidebars-pro/">Custom Sidebar Pro</a> for all your widget, sidebar and footer needs.</strong>

Finally a mayor release, <a title="Custom sidebars wordpress page" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-sidebars" target="_blank"> Custom Sidebars 1.0 is out</a>! It has a lot of improvements, specially AJAX management. But AJAX relies on javascript, and becouse of that only WP3.3 installations could run the new version of Custom Sidebars.
<h4 style="text-align: center;">So if your Wordpress is older than 3.3 DO NOT UPGRADE YOUR PLUGIN.</h4>
If you already did, just <a title="Custom sidebars versions" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-sidebars/download/" target="_blank">downloading the version 0.8.2</a> everything should return to normal.

I really would like to explain all the improvements slowly, so I will take my time to update this post, until then, feel free to leave a message.
